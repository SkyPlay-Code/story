                <p>Your heart is a <span class="word-shake">hummingbird</span> trapped in your ribs. You try to focus on the teacher's lecture, but it’s just white noise. Every nerve in your body is screamingly aware of him.</p>
                <p>The way his pen scratches against the paper. The quiet sound of his breathing. The ghost of his lips still burned onto yours from the night before.</p>
                <p>That smile he gave you... it was worse than an intense stare. It was a secret, a quiet confirmation between two people in a room full of strangers. It said, <span style="font-style: italic; color: #aeb8c9;">"I remember everything. And I know you do too."</span></p>

                <p>You force yourself to look at the board, your cheeks burning. You can't handle this. The silence is too loud.</p>
                <p>Just as you think you are going to explode from the tension, something appears in your peripheral vision. A small, folded piece of paper, appearing on the edge of your desk as if by magic.</p>
                <p>Your fingers tremble as you pick it up. You unfold it under your desk. The handwriting is rushed, but you'd recognize it anywhere:</p>
                
                <div class="paper-note">
                    "Did you sleep well? Or were you up all night thinking about the rain?"
                </div>

                <p>Your breath catches. <span class="word-gold">"The rain."</span> That’s what he’s calling it. A secret code for the storm that happened between you.</p>

                <p>A few minutes later, you feel a presence beside you. You don't have to look. He moved. He didn't ask. He just picked up his chair and his books, and now he is sitting right next to you.</p>
                <p>The air between you is thick, <span class="word-gold">electric</span>. You are both staring straight ahead, pretending to listen to the lesson, but this is a different kind of class now.</p>
                <p>Then you feel it.</p>
                <p>The subtle, deliberate pressure of his <span class="word-thump">knee</span> brushing against yours under the desk. It’s not an accident. He lets it rest there. It’s a quiet, possessive touch in a room where everyone can see you, but no one knows what is really happening.</p>
                <p>It's a current of electricity running straight from his leg to yours. He is marking his territory. He is reminding you who you belong to.</p>

                <div class="dialogue">"Stay after class. Meet me at the bus stop. We need to talk."</div>
                <p>Just as he pulls away, the bell rings, sharp and loud, shattering the moment. He stands up, gives you one last, quick, unreadable glance, and disappears into the crowd.</p>
                <p>Leaving you to wonder... what happens when the <span class="word-blur" style="color: #b91d1d;">storm</span> returns?</p>

                <p>He breathes out. It’s not a statement; it’s a relief. The tension in his shoulders drops just an inch.</p>
                <p>"I told myself you wouldn't," he says quietly, looking at his shoes then back at you. "That I scared you off."</p>
                <p>You shake your head, wanting to speak, but your voice is stuck in your throat. He takes a step closer. The distance between you is gone. The air isn't cold anymore; it’s <span class="word-burn">warm</span> with the heat radiating off him.</p>

                <p>He whispers, his eyes squeezing shut for a moment as if he's in pain. "Was yesterday just the adrenaline? Was it just the storm?"</p>
                <p>He pulls back just enough to look into your eyes, searching deep into your soul. The vulnerability in his face breaks your heart and makes it race at the same time.</p>

                <p>He waits, his hand still cupping your face. He is the storm, but right now, he is waiting for you to decide if you want to step into it.</p>
